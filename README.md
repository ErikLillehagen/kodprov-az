# Hello there
I had a lot of fun building this app.

Some issues I had:
* I have not found a way to search for more than 10 items. Perhaps possible, but nothing about it in tvmazes documentation, and I didn't have time to experiment


# Installation
I chose to use pnpm instead of npm.

to install dependencies run `pnpm i` in the root folder of the project

# Running the application
### `pnpm start`
Starts the application and makes it available on localhost:3000

### `pnpm test`
runs tests
