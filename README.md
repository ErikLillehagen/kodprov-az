# README
This is a simple web app that lets you search for tv-shows. You can view detailed information about the shows too!

##If I had more time I would have added:
* More tests
* A way to add shows to favourites
* History so a user can see past searches
* Greater details about shows
* Accessibility improvements (better contrasts, A11y)

##Some issues I had:
* I have not found a way to search for more than 10 items. Perhaps possible, but nothing about it in tvmazes documentation.


# Installation
I chose to use pnpm instead of npm.

to install dependencies run `pnpm i` in the root folder of the project

# Running the application
### `pnpm start`
Starts the application and makes it available on localhost:3000

### `pnpm test`
